# ERRORS & WARNING MESSAGES
######################################################################

# The errors/warning messages that you encountered and how you overcame them (these should be in the form of markdown cells)
# NOTE: E stands for error

# E1) Warned me that there was a new version of pip (couldn't copy and paste from command line yet)
  # Updated pip following instructions on screen. Received one "syntax" error messages because I was not in the right folder
  # for the python installation. "'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."
  # Took less than minutes to get to the right path, update pip and confirm that all the other
  # Anaconda items were up-to-date.

# Was it straightforward to install Python and all of the libraries?
########################################################################

# Yes. Python, pip and related support systems in Anacondan required updates based on a warning message in Command Prompt
  # Followed instructions to update PIP. Everything else was up-to-date (See aabove)
  # Accidentally tried to install from wrong folder at first. Needed to ensure was in the correct folder using cd.. But minor issue. 
  # Numpy, SciPi, and MatLab libraries all installed simply. Received confirmation that they worked (i.e., "Requirement already   
  # satisfied:") 

  # NOTE:  SciPi did not require the complicated steps listed in instructions
  # C:\Program Files>pip install scipy
  # Requirement already satisfied: scipy in c:\programdata\anaconda3\lib\site-packages

  # NOTE: 
  # In Windows 10 for install remember that people need to run the command prompt as an Administrator (Right Click)
